# Hosting on the Web without the Fluff




## Prelude
I have a simple rust application that I want to host on the web that can be found [here](https://github.com/NitroSniper/ortin.git).
Oftenly when trying to find ways of hosting, I come across tools such as Terraform, Kubernetes and AWS. 
Although these tools are great I'm just hosting a simple website that doesn't need 

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("hello world");
}

```
